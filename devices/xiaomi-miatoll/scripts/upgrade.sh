# (The Galaxy S9 Snapdragon port's, Davitekk/ztOS devices/samsung-starqltechn, with this phone's names.)
# Keep the phone's data across a ztOS upgrade. A new ztOS version is a new
# root image (ztOS's own parts are built into it, so ztos-update's pacman
# cannot bring them), and flash.sh writes the whole of USERDATA: save
# what is the user's first, then put it back on the new system.
#
#   devices/xiaomi-miatoll/scripts/upgrade.sh save [file]       the old system, booted
#   devices/xiaomi-miatoll/scripts/upgrade.sh restore <file>    the new one, after its first boot
#
# An upgrade, start to end:
#   1. upgrade.sh save
#   2. in fastboot: devices/xiaomi-miatoll/scripts/flash.sh
#   3. boot ztOS and wait for the lock screen (the first boot grows the
#      filesystem and sets up the user)
#   4. upgrade.sh restore backups/miatoll/<file>; the phone reboots
#
# Kept: every home (settings, files, Android's apps and their data), Wi-Fi
# networks, Bluetooth pairings, calls and messages, the access point, the
# learned performance and sensor state, the clock's RTC offset, the SSH host
# keys, the time zone and
# the user's password. Waydroid's images too, unless the new system already
# has its own. Not kept: packages installed with pacman (listed at the end,
# to install again) and the rest of the system, which is the new version's.
# Both systems must have the same user (the installer's --user).
#
# The file holds Wi-Fi passwords and messages: it stays in backups/ (not in
# the repository). Over the USB link, ssh to alarm@172.16.42.1 (ZTOS_PHONE
# and ZTOS_SSH_PORT for others); the password is asked once, for ssh and sudo.
# Runs on Linux, macOS and Git Bash on Windows.
